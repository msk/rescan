# REscan

REscan is a work-in-progress port of the
[Hyperscan](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan) regular expression matching
library to Rust.

[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/gh/msk/rescan/branch/master/graphs/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/msk/rescan)

This crate is in a very early stage. Only parsing very basic regular expressions
is done. The first goal is to make a string literal matching work. Any help is
welcome!

## Requirements

REscan requires Rust version 1.42 or greater.
